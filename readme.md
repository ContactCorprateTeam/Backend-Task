# Backend task

## Objective:

The goal of this task is to elevate the existing project, accessible at this repository, to a higher standard by implementing key software engineering best practices and modern architectural principles. The focus will be on adopting a microservices architecture, providing comprehensive API specification documentation, incorporating Docker for containerization, ensuring scalability, implementing unit testing with Jest, and establishing a robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Tasks:

1. **Microservices Architecture:**
    - Analyze the current monolithic architecture and design a microservices architecture using NestJS.
    - Identify service boundaries, API contracts, and data models to ensure a modular and scalable system.
    - Implement microservices in a way that facilitates independent deployment and scaling.
2. **API Specification Documentation:**
    - Generate comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.
    - Document endpoints, request/response structures, and any authentication mechanisms.
    - Ensure that the API documentation is kept up-to-date with code changes.
3. **Docker Integration:**
    - Create Dockerfiles for each microservice to enable containerization.
    - Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the deployment of microservices and any required infrastructure components.
    - Ensure that the Docker configuration is optimized for scalability and ease of deployment.
4. **Scalability:**
    - Implement strategies for horizontal scaling of microservices to handle increased load.
    - Evaluate and choose appropriate database technologies that support scalability requirements.
    - Optimize code and infrastructure to ensure efficient resource utilization.
5. **Unit Testing with Jest:**
    - Write unit tests for each microservice using Jest.
    - Ensure that tests cover critical functionality and edge cases.
    - Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce code quality.
6. **CI/CD Implementation:**
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a suitable platform (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
    - Configure automated builds, testing, and deployment for each microservice.
    - Implement continuous integration to catch issues early in the development process.
7. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):**
    - Create an ERD to visually represent the data model used in the microservices.
    - Include relationships between entities and any constraints.
    - Ensure the ERD is clear, well-documented, and aligns with the microservices architecture.

## Notes:

- Utilize NestJS for implementing the microservices architecture.
- Employ Jest as the testing framework for unit testing.
- Make use of version control (e.g., Git) and provide meaningful commit messages.
- Ensure thorough documentation for each step of the refactoring process.
- Keep a focus on maintainability, scalability, and adherence to best practices throughout the refactoring.
